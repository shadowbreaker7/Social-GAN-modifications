# Social-GAN-modifications
Social GAN is from https://github.com/agrimgupta92/sgan.

I just made several modifications for our research project where there is a multiagent-attacker-defender-battle environment. 


Visualization is modified from https://github.com/marsmarcin/Visual-of-Social-GAN, where I change the cases/situations picking up mechanism.


Data processing only meet the requirements of the datasets created by Automotive Research Center, 
University of Michigan.


The forecasting_sample dataset is from Argo.
